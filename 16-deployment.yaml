# This is a simple example of a deployment that manages multiple pods running nginx
      # It ensures that the specified number of replicas are always running
      # pod is subset of deployment, deployment is subset of replicaset
      # If a pod fails, the deployment will create a new one to maintain the desired number of replicas
