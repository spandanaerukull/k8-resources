      # This is a simple example of a replicaset that manages multiple pods running nginx
      # It ensures that the specified number of replicas are always running 
      #pod is subset of replicaset, replicaset is subset of deployment
      # If a pod fails, the replicaset will create a new one to maintain the desired number of replicas
